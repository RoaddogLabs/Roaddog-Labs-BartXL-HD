## Roaddog Labs Bart Pro XL-LC
## 
This is a Roaddog Bart XL-LC 3D printer. This machine is a larger build
based on a mashup implemented from several designs including original
designs.  Original designs from Roaddog Labs Ltd are released per the
Open Source Hardware Association guidelines for open source hardware at
http://www.oshwa.org/definition/.

#####Bart Pro XL-LC is a lower cost version and a good upgrade platform for those with a Prusa i3 or Rework i3 variant to upgrade to a better frame and larger build area.  The LC variant uses M8 X and Z smooth rods and M5 threaded rod for the Z drive screw.  The LC uses Rework i3 printed parts.

This design is a legacy design and is frozen.  Feel free to fork it and add to it as you would like.
